# Day 3 — Cursor + AI (Summary)

## What I Learned

* Using key AI shortcuts in Cursor:

  * `Ctrl+K` — AI on selected code
  * `Ctrl+L` — general AI chat
  * `Ctrl+/` — toggle comment
  * `Ctrl+P` — quick file open
* Writing effective prompts with clear requirements
* Improving existing functions using AI
* Debugging with AI by providing:

  * the exact error
  * the code
  * what I expected vs. what happened
* Using AI as an assistant, not as a replacement for understanding

## Exercises Completed

* Improved functions: `divide`, `find_duplicates`, `count_characters`
* Asked AI for explanations using `Ctrl+K`
* Created cleaner, more pythonic versions of functions
* Handled edge cases (empty input, invalid types)

## Key Insights

* Precise prompts → better output
* AI speeds up development but shouldn't replace logic understanding
* Debugging is easier when sharing minimal reproducible examples
* Clean code = clear names, docstrings, type hints

## What We Did NOT Cover Yet

* Full Claude Code integration
* Multi-file refactoring
* Advanced code actions / automated improvements

## Checklist

* [x] Basic AI shortcuts
* [x] Prompt writing practice
* [x] AI-assisted debugging
* [x] Code cleanup with docstrings
* [ ] Advanced Claude Code tools (optional)
